This thesis presents a novel approach to energy price prediction using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. The thesis was a collaborative effort between myself, Romina Belloc (Argentina), and Mirxat Aizaizi Muerxiati (naturalized Chinese-Turkish), all of whom are currently established in Spain and met while pursuing master's degrees in Data Science at the European University of Madrid.

For our thesis, we collected historical energy price data through APIs from energy supply companies, as well as synthetic data on social and political events. We then used this data to train an LSTM neural network to predict future energy prices. Our results demonstrate that the LSTM neural network is capable of predicting energy prices with acceptable accuracy, even in the presence of complex temporal patterns and non-linear relationships in the data.
